# FirstSteps
Infos for students

There are solutions to most problems on StackOverflow and the Biostar Forum.

If you are stuck you can also always post in our slack questions channel!

Please also have a look at our collection of coding tasks. Most likely there will be some usefull things for your analysis!


## Learning bash and using the cluster

Datacamp:  https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-shell,  https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-bash-scripting

Coding tasks from Andre about bash and conda and awk geschrieben: https://github.com/ZarnackGroup/Zarnack_CodingTasks/tree/master/shell_usage, https://github.com/ZarnackGroup/Zarnack_CodingTasks/tree/master/conda_usage, https://github.com/ZarnackGroup/Zarnack_CodingTasks/tree/master/awk_table_manipulation_in_shell. 

Ask someone for the Biostar handbook. It is very helpfull.


When you want to use the cluster (key file und passwort from Stefan), this is how to access it:

## Learning R

Good book on statistcs in R for Biologists:
https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/

Look at our coding tasks:

And there is a lot of good stuff in data camp about R. For example:
